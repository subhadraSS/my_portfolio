                 hi! I’m Subha, your friendly neighborhood Business Analyst with 4+ years of experience crunching data, debugging Python, SQL mazes, Power BI, and Tableau like I’m running a circus, and whipping up dashboards that actually tell a story (not just sit there looking pretty). 📊
What gets me out of bed? Well, aside from a strong cup of coffee or delicious spicy chai ☕, it’s making data do the talking. From analyzing trends to presenting strategic insights that actually drive decisions, I’m on a mission to turn boring numbers into action.

I’m currently working at Engageware, where I’m refining my skills, but let’s be real: I’m not just here to work. I’m here to learn, grow, and eventually take on a Product Owner role where I can really drive data-based decision-making.

Outside the 9 to 5, I’m an ardent reader of fiction 📚, Call Of Duty mobile player(outlet to my frustrations), a serial people/bird-watcher (parks are my happy place 🛋️), and yes, I might be the person who stops mid-walk to stargaze. If you vibe with any of this, let’s connect, chat, or geek out over data, books, or your favorite frappuccino).
